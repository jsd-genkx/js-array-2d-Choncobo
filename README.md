# Exercise 01: Navigating the 3x3 Grid!

## Instructions:

You are given a 3x3 grid with labeled cells. Your task is to simulate a journey through the grid using specific movements. Use the array to represent the grid and track your path with an array that records each move you make.

Goal: Start at cell A (position [0][0]) and move through the grid using a combination of right, down, and left movements. Make sure to track each cell you visit.

> Start at A
>
> Move right to B
>
> Move right to C
>
> Move down to F
>
> Move left to E

## Steps:

1. Create a 3x3 grid using a 2D array.
2. Use variables x and y to keep track of your current position on the grid.
3. Use .push() to record each position visited in the moves array.
4. Print the journey as a string separated by "â†’" and output the total number of moves (excluding the starting position).

## Task:

### Complete the provided code. (file: game.js)

```js
// Move Right to C

// Move Down to F

// Move left to E
```

## Bonus Task:

### Create functions to complete the provided code. (file: game-fn.js)

```js
function moveRight() {}

function moveLeft() {}

function moveUp() {}

function moveDown() {}
```
